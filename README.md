# tcpip_abstraction
Tcp for linux , macOS and windows .

You can use CMake for build(linux and macOS). You can use visual studio project file (sln file) for msvc(Visual Studio).
It tested with <b>macOS</b> , <b>linux</b> and <b>windows(msvc)</b> yet.
As soon as posible I will test in Windows with mingw(windows).
